## ETCswap Launchpad

Welcome to the ETCswap Launchpad docs.

The pages here contain conceptual and technical documentation of the Launchpad protocol.

If you are new to ETCswap Launchpad, you might want to check out the [Launchpad overview](../launchpad/concepts/protocol-overview/how-launchpad-works) first.

ETCswap Launchpad allows its users to create tokens in seconds, without any required knowledge and without needing to provide liquidity.

The created token, which is free of charge except for gas fees, becomes instantly tradable on the platform.
