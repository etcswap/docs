ETCswap Launchpad is designed to allow projects to efficiently raise funds and swiftly distribute tokens on decentralized exchanges (DEX). Below are the key features and how operates.


Tokens are created with virtual liquidity (bonding curve), and it is the investors who contribute to the liquidity pool (LP) through their buys and sells.

1. Initial Market Cap
The Initial Market Cap is determined by the target raising amount set by the Minter (the project creator).

The Minter can freely set the target raising amount, which serves as a crucial indicator for the project's capital raising and initial valuation.

The Market Cap is further influenced by the Bonding Curve, which dictates how token prices will change during the presale process and impacts the overall market valuation of the project.

2. Automatic DEX Distribution Upon Reaching the Bonding Curve
Once the Minter's target raising amount is achieved, the tokens are immediately deployed to ETCswap. This ensures investors have instant access to liquidity, allowing the project to quickly enter the market.

3. LP Token Burn and DEX Lock
After the tokens are deployed on ETCswap, the generated Liquidity Pool (LP) tokens are burned.

Once burned, these LP tokens are permanently locked ETCswap, ensuring the project's liquidity remains secured and permanently tied to ETCswap. This reinforces trust and stability in the liquidity pool.
