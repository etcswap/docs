## Protocol, Interface, Company

To begin, we should make clear the distinctions between the different areas of "ETCswap", some of which may confuse new users.

- **White B0x Inc.**: The company which developed the ETCswap protocol, along with the web interface.
- **The ETCswap V2 Protocol**: A suite of persistent, non-upgradable smart contracts that together create an automated market maker, a protocol that facilitates peer-to-peer market making and swapping of ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum Classic blockchain.
- **The ETCswap Interface**: A web interface that allows for easy interaction with the ETCswap V2 protocol. The interface is only one of many ways one may interact with the ETCswap V2 protocol.
